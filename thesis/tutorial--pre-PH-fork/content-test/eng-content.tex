NCKU offers an open learning environment characterized by classical Western and modern eastern landscape. NCKU has attracted numerous distinguished visitors around the world for its rich and welcoming campuses.

In addition to two off-university campuses, An-Nan and Gueiren, the main campus of NCKU consists of 7 satellite campuses adjacent to one another. NCKU occupies a total of more than 180 hectares of land, which tops many other universities in Taiwan. NCKU started out as having only one campus, Cheng Kung, but continued to expand to its current scale. Each campus in the major part of NCKU is closely interlinked and tightly developed as a city within the university.

NCKU's spirit of ``pristine practicality'' and its motto of ``intellectual development through persistent pursuit of knowledge'' have been intrinsic to the thick cultural heritage of the city of Tainan. While members of NCKU are well-integrated with one another, they also work independently. Patrons as NCKU enjoy abundant learning resources.

Through continuous evolution and progression, NCKU has become an active participant in global academia and has earned an excellent reputation in teaching and research. For example, NCKU has ranked the 256th in 2010 Academic Ranking of World Universities announced by Shanghai Jiaotong University and the 80th in 2011 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities published by Centre for Scientific Information and Documentation, Spain, only second to that of NTU, Todai and Kyodai in the Asian region.
